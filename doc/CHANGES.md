# Version 0.4

## Upgrade notes
* Remember to `rake db:migrate` and `git submodule update`
* Ensure you have values for new config variables (see `config/general.yml-example`):
  * FORWARD_NONBOUNCE_RESPONSES_TO
  * TRACK_SENDER_EMAIL
  * TRACK_SENDER_NAME
* Execute `script/rebuild-xapian-index` to create new xapian index terms used in latest version of search (can take a long time)

## Highlighted features
* Complete overhaul of design, including improved search, modern look and feel, more twitter links, etc
* A banner alerts visitors from other countries to existing sites in their country, or exhorts them to make their own
* Bounce emails that result from user alerts are automatically processed and hard bouncing accounts do not continue to receive alerts


# Version 0.3

## Highlighted features
* New search filters / UI on request page, authorities page, and search page.  Upgrades require a rebuild of the Xapian index (`./script/xapian-index-rebuild`).  Design isn't beautiful; to be fixed in next release.
* Introduce reCaptcha for people apparently coming from foreign countries (to combat spam) (requires values for new config variables `ISO_COUNTRY_CODE` and `GAZE_URL`, and existing config variables `RECAPTCHA_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RECAPTCHA_PRIVATE_KEY`)
* Better admin interface for editing multiple translations of a public body at once
